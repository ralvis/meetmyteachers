  <h1> Visual Media </h1>
  <h2> Taught by: Carlos Evia </h2>
<p>
This so far has been my favorite class I have ever taken at Virginia Tech. It focuses on teaching the students fundamental aspects of creating visual media whether that be a magazine layout, photography, filming videos and editing or constructing a website. These areas of communication are what I really hope to be doing when I enter the real world and have a real person job. This class has taught me many new skills as well as allowing me to build on skills I already had. I have been pushed creatively and I have created projects that I am really proud of. Another part of this class that I really love is the opportunities we have for group work. I have always loved group work because it allows for many different perspectives and in the end, I believe a stronger final product.

  With everything we are learning and doing in class, it would not be possible without my sassy, smart and hilarious professor. His positive attitude and his confidence in our abilities has motivated me and pushed me to continue to create projects in and out of the classroom that I am very proud of. He is a very passionate person both inside and out of the class. Some of his interests include monkeys, chicken recipes, and spending time with his daughter watching Disney princess movies.

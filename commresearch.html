  This is a class I have really enjoyed so far this semester which was a surprise to me. Initially, I thought this class would be very boring because personally, I do not have a large interest in research. I have been surprised though at how much I am learning and how much of what I am learning I will be able to use in the workplace. We are learning different ways of conducting research and gathering info. I have found the most interest in Human Subjects Research. This is the kind of research that is most common in communications fields. This type of research is very subjective and allows for a depth of information to be received by the researcher. This type of research does not involve numbers but it involves opinions and ideas. Doing research based on people opinions is very important for my future jobs because I am learning how to gather information from the audience the company would want to reach. I enjoy learning about this because this can be a great way in the future for me to help whoever I work for have more success reaching the audience they want and hopefully increasing the company's success!

  Much of my enjoyment in this class comes from my very motivated and talented professor. Dr. Katherine Haenschen. She is a very interesting woman with many different passions and interests. She has a love for traveling and has spent time backpacking across Europe. She has also traveled and spent time in Asia and South America. This semester she got to go out to Utah for one of the biggest communications conferences in the country. She also has a passion for cooking, recently she has been spending a lot of time cooking with her husband. Together they have been cooking recipes from the cookbook Smitten Every Day.

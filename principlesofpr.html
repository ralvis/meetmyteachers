  <h1> Principles of Public Relations </h1>
  <h2> Taught by: Douglas F. Cannon and Caitlin McDaniel </h2>
<p>
  I wanted to take a moment to talk about what I am learning Principles of Public Relations. In this class, we have the main professor, Professor Cannon, he is the person who has designed the class but many sections are taught by teaching assistants. My section is taught by the TA Caitlin McDaniel. She is an awesome young TA who is getting her masters at Virginia Tech. She has a clear passion for public relations and communication and because of this, she is able to teach us the information in a very understandable way! One thing she loves as a native Hokie herself is Virginia Tech football, even though they are not having their best season. She also is a big fan of the Patriots and has a special place in her heart for Tom Brady. Aside from football she loves spending time outside and cooking!

  Throughout the class, we have learned a lot about what the job of a public relations practitioner requires. I have learned a lot about the dynamics of a job in PR and I have also learned a lot about how to effectively communicate a message. Something I have found the most interesting is the concept of crisis management. Such a large part of the PR field is being able to fix other peoples mistakes. I have found the strategies to help maintain a companies audience very fascinating and I hope this is something I will be able to utilize in the future. I know what I am learning in this class I will be able to actually use in my future job!

  <h1> World Regions </h1>
  <h2> Taught by: John Boyer </h2>
<p>
This is a class I am taking online that teaches students about the different regions of the world and how they developed the way that they did. This is the first online class I have taken at Virginia Tech and I have learned that this is not the most productive way for me to learn. Throughout the semester this class has felt like a burden and I very much dislike not have an in-class portion. I do enjoy what we are learning about because history has always been one of my favorite subjects. It is difficult to talk about my professor because he doesn't even live in Virginia, but based on the information I have gathered from his syllabus, lectures and quizzes I can tell he has a great sense of humor, passion for history, and two really cute dogs! Some of his other interests include international movies and telling dad jokes. Overall, I am grateful that I took this class so I now know to never take an online class again!
